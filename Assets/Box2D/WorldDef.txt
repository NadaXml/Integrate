--- World definition used to create a simulation world.
--- Must be initialized using b2DefaultWorldDef().

--- @class B2D.WorldDef
local WorldDef = {}

--- Gravity vector. Box2D has no up-vector defined.
--- @type Vec2
WorldDef.Gravity = nil

--- Restitution velocity threshold, usually in m/s. Collisions above this
--- speed have restitution applied (will bounce).
--- @type float
WorldDef.RestitutionThreshold = nil

--- This parameter controls how fast overlap is resolved and has units of meters per second
--- @type float
WorldDef.ContactPushoutVelocity = nil

--- Threshold velocity for hit events. Usually meters per second.
--- @type float
WorldDef.HitEventThreshold = nil

--- Contact stiffness. Cycles per second.
--- @type float
WorldDef.ContactHertz = nil

--- Contact bounciness. Non-dimensional.
--- @type float
WorldDef.ContactDampingRatio = nil

--- Joint stiffness. Cycles per second.
--- @type float
WorldDef.JointHertz = nil

--- Joint bounciness. Non-dimensional.
--- @type float
WorldDef.JointDampingRatio = nil

--- Maximum linear velocity. Usually meters per second.
--- @type float
WorldDef.MaximumLinearVelocity = nil

--- Can bodies go to sleep to improve performance
--- @type bool
WorldDef.EnableSleep = nil

--- Enable continuous collision
--- @type bool
WorldDef.EnableContinuous = nil

--- Number of workers to use with the provided task system. Box2D performs best when using only
---	performance cores and accessing a single L2 cache. Efficiency cores and hyper-threading provide
---	little benefit and may even harm performance.
--- @type int
WorldDef.WorkerCount = nil

--- Function to spawn tasks
--- @type EnqueueTaskCallback?
WorldDef.EnqueueTask = nil

--- Function to finish a task
--- @type FinishTaskCallback?
WorldDef.FinishTask = nil

--- User context that is provided to enqueueTask and finishTask
--- @type object
WorldDef.UserTaskContext = nil

--- Used internally to detect a valid definition. DO NOT SET.
--- @type int
WorldDef.InternalValue = nil

--- Use this to initialize your world definition
